# Discovering Scientist as a helper to do large refactorings
 A common behaviour pattern in software businesses is that many of the companies don't pay enough attention to overall quality of their code base. The reasoning for such a behaviour is mostly defended by the claim that paying attention to "fast delivery to market" is far more important than software quality aspects of  the product or caring more about whether the functionality is there, is what really matters for the business. 
 
 During early stages of a project/product this claim has the ( false ) appearance of being true, because your code base has not grown that large yet and you are delivering to your customers with an incredible velocity, there is no point in caring  about this technical nonsense. However, as time goes by, this kind of approach causes the technical debt to pile up. It slowly starts to cripple your market maneuvering capability. It's like introducing junk food to your life without any exercise. They might be tasty and easy to consume at the beginning, and ,you know exercising, is hard. You don't need to care about them because you're perfectly handling your daily tasks. 
 
 
  As it's the case with many of these kind of code bases, we are facing deep coupling problems, vaguely distributed business concepts, and lots of bought in or unintentionally introduced technical debts. 

There are good books, which specifically describe methods and approaches
