# CI/CD as Code
The purpose of these sample series is to create a simple set of examples,  which showcases **CI/CD as Code**, using Jenkins. Primary goal is to create a stateless CI/CD setup, which can be bootstrapped from a set of configuration files and scripts so that many problems related to maintenance of the infrastructure and other operational issues are reduced. 

A step by step approach is followed while implementing the examples. The documentation regarding each step can be reached using the links below. 

## Sample Steps
1. [Introduce a statefully containerised Jenkins](docs/1_dockerised_jenkins.md)
2. [Complete the basic setup of Jenkins via code](docs/2_jenkins_basic_setup.md): The goal of this step is to complete **basic setup** of Jenkins completely programmatically. 
3. [First steps to 'job as code'](docs/3_introduce_scripted_jobs.md) : In this step, we are going to head towards configuring jobs programmatically.
